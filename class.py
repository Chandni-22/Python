'''OOP: Object-oriented programming (OOP) is like organizing your code by thinking about things as objects. Imagine your code is like a toy box, called "class", and each toy is an object. OOP helps you keep your toys (or objects) organized and easy to play with.'''

'''Q-1.) Write a Python class Employee with attributes like emp_id, emp_name, emp_salary, and emp_department and methods like calculate_emp_salary, emp_assign_department, and print_employee_details. Sample Employee Data:
"ADAMS", "E7876", 50000, "ACCOUNTING"
"JONES", "E7499", 45000, "RESEARCH"
"MARTIN", "E7900", 50000, "SALES"
"SMITH", "E7698", 55000, "OPERATIONS"

1) Use the 'assign_department' method to change the department of an employee.
2) Use the 'print_employee_details' method to print the details of an employee.
3) The 'calculate_emp_salary' method takes two arguments: salary and hours_worked, which is the number of hours worked by the employee. If the number of hours worked is more than 50, the method computes overtime and adds it to the salary. Overtime is calculated as following formula:

overtime = hours_worked - 50
Overtime amount = (overtime * (salary / 50))'''
